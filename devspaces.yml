# If you want to use a public Docker image to start your DevSpace from, enter the
# name and tag here. By default we will look for a Dockerfile in this same
# directory.
# docker-image: pivotalpa/angular-cli:1.4.2

# If you want to use a different Dockerfile for your DevSpace, provide the path
# here. You cannot specify both docker-image and docker-file
# docker-file: Dockerfile

# If you need additional files when building you Dockerfile, such as some
# application binaries that you Dockerfile references, list the glob paths to
# include here. They are relative to this devspaces.yml file.
# Every path should be configured in a new line

#
# Any environment variable specified here is injected into the build and/or
# runtime environment of the Docker container.
# The *Shared* flag determines if the value of the environment variable is shared
#   when this DevSpace is shared with others. The default is to share environment
#   variable values. If there is a value that should be set differently by every
#   developer that the DevSpace is shared with then Shared should be set to No.
#   An example of a value not to share is a API key that every developer generates
#   for themselves.
# The *Scope* enum determines if the environment variable is used at buildtime
# (docker build), runtime (docker run) or both. The acceptable values are 'run',
# 'build' and 'all'. If unspecified, scope is 'all' by default.
